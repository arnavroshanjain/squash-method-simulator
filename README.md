# squash-method-simulator
Simulates squash matches to compare different scoring systems, specifically Point-a-rally scoring (PARS) and English scoring. The simulator models match between players with different skill levels to analyse which scoring system might be more effective.

## Features
- **Simulation of squash games**: Implements two scoring methods to evaluate their impact on the game outcomes.
- **Customizable player abilities**: Allows inputting different ability levels for each player to simulate various match scenarios.
- **Probability-based game outcomes**: Uses a mathematical model to determine the outcome of each point based on the players' abilities.

## How to Use
To run the simulation:
1. **Clone the repository and follow the commands as follows in the command line**:
     
2.   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/squash-match-simulator.git

3.   cd squash-match-simulator

4.   pip install notebook
     (if jupyter notebook is not installed)
5.   jupyter notebook simulator.ipynb
